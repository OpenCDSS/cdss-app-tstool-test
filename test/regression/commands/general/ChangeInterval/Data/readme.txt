The time series CHANGE-T_DAY_IN.SQME was generated from the Test_ChangeInterval_DayMean_To_6HourINST.TSTool
commands file. 

This time series (CHANGE-T_DAY_IN.SQME) was copied to the linux directory:
/projects/nwrfc_2008/calb/data/area_ts/TSToolTest/

and the NWSRFS mcp3 input deck:
/projects/nwrfc_2008/calb/input/mcp3/decks/nwrfc/2008/TSToolTest/CHANGE-T.mcp3
(copied into this directory as well)


was run to output the files:
CHANGE-T_6hr_OUT.SQIN
CHANGE-T_3hr_OUT.SQIN

The precision of the output files can be changed if needed in the mcp3 input deck.
