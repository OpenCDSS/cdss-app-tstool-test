ParshallSpeechtoRotaryClub,Study,1956-01-01 00:00,,Parshall Speech to Rotary Club,"R. Parshall presents to FC Rotary Club that seepage return flow in 1956 was “nil” partly because >4000 wells pumped enough water to fill Horsetooth Reservoir 4x  during 1955 season. This affected senior direct flow diversion & reservoir storage causing many diversions to be severely curtailed, some receiving no water during extended periods from 1955 to 1957.",myloc

SB03-73,ColoradoLawPassed,2003-04-30 00:00,,Senate Bill 03-73 - Surface & Ground Water Rights Consensus Bill,"From a committee commissioned by Ken Salazar to work on compromise legislation emerged Senate Bill 03-73 which provides that the State Engineer can approve SWSPs for wells in South Platte Basin through December 31, 2005, & that thereafter, the wells will be curtailed unless they are included in a water court-approved plan for augmentation, are the subject of a pending water court application for approval of a plan for augmentation, or can be operated under their own priorities without augmentation.

SouthPlatteWellOwners,WellAugmentationGroup,2003-06-01 00:00,,South Platte Well Owners,Group comprised of former GASP members. Water Court approved SWSP of 380 wells.,myloc
DemiseOfGASP,WellAugmentationGroup,2004-01-01 00:00,2006-01-01 00:00,GASP Breaks-up/Dissolves,"As a result of drought and nearly year-round calls on the river through 2004, replacement of depletions caused by wells required considerably more augmentation water and GASP ultimately went out of business leaving hundreds of wells without augmentation coverage. It finished its sale of 
water assets in 2006. Central GMS had to scramble to lease additional water in order to obtain approval of its SWSP during those years.",myloc
CentralWAS,WellAugmentationGroup,2004-01-01 00:00,,Central WAS Formed,"Central CO Water Conservancy District established the Well Augmentation Subdistrict (Central WAS) which included the above 380 wells and 61 additional wells, for a total of 441 wells.

CentralGMSProjectionTool,Technology,2005-05-01 00:00,,Central GMS Projection Tool,"After lengthy multi-party negotiations, GMS settled out of court with water users opposing its plan & presented a stipulated augmentation plan to the judge. The resulting consent decree contained numerous restrictive terms & conditions for the protection of senior water rights, & also utilized a “projection tool” to forecast future depletions and anticipated replacement of GMS member wells.",myloc

WASWithdrewAugPlanApplication,WellAugmentationGroup,2006-01-01 00:00,,WAS Withdraws Augmentation Plan Application,"With the prospect of the SWSP application being denied because of a lack of augmentation water that year, Central WAS withdrew its application for an augmentation plan to the Water Court. The lack of an SWSP forced 449 wells to cease pumping until the Water Court approves an augmentation plan. ",myloc
WASTrial,WellAugmentationGroup,2007-02-05 00:00,2007-06-14 00:00,WAS Trial,"As the February trial date neared, WAS dropped 230 wells from the applications, leaving approximately 219 wells in the plan. The water judge ruled that WAS did not have to replace any depletions associated with dropped wells, except for those depletions associated with operations under the 2003, 2004, and 2005 SWSPs. WAS was not able to settle out of court with senior surface rights owners opposing the application, & WAS wells did not receive temporary approval to operate in 2006 & were curtailed.",myloc

The Task Force met six times from June 29 to September 30, 2007 and eventually made ten recommendations to the Governor.",myloc
WASGroundWaterRechargeProgram,Technology,2008-01-01 00:00,,WAS Ground Water Recharge Program ,"Faced with relatively small amounts of permanent supply & insufficient available funding to allow the large scale purchase of senior water rights, WAS developed an aggressive program of groundwater recharge designed to capture “free” river water during times of surplus and re-time it to replace well depletions. WAS’ recharge program consists of a series of shallow infiltration basins, generally located on existing ditch systems. The same analytical equations used to calculate depletions are then used to calculate “accretions” & predict when the accretions will supplement flows. By operating augmentation & headgate wells together, these facilities give WAS the ability to take water when it is available and retime it to match the pattern of groundwater depletions caused by member wells used for irrigation.
