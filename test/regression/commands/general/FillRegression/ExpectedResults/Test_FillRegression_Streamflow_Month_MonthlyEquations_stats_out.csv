# The following statistics are computed to determine and evaluate the the regression relationships.
# The regression type performed was:  OLSRegression
# X indicates the independent time series and Y indicates the dependent time series.
# Some statistics are ignored for some regression approaches, but are provided for comparison.
# 
# 
# Monthly statistics (for case where NumberOfEquations=MonthlyEquatations) will have a _M subscript, where M is the month (1=January, 12=December).
