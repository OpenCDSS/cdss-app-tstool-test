# 
# The following statistics are computed to determine and evaluate the the regression relationships.
# The regression type performed was:  OLSRegression
# X indicates the independent time series and Y indicates the dependent time series.
# Some statistics are ignored for some regression approaches, but are provided for comparison.
# 
# N1 - Count of non-missing data points overlapping in the dependent and independent time series
# MeanX1 - Mean of the independent N1 values
# SX1 - Standard deviation of the independent N1 values
# N2 - Count of the non-missing data points in the independent time series outside of N1
# MeanX2 - Mean of the independent N2 values
# SX2 - Standard deviation of the independent N2 values
# MeanY1 - Mean of the dependent N1 values
# SY1 - Standard deviation of the dependent N1 values
# NY - Count of the non-missing dependent values
# MeanY - Mean of the NY values
# SY - Standard deviation of the NY values
# SkewY - skew of the NY values
# a - The intercept for the relationship equation
# b - The slope of the relationship equation
# R - The correlation coefficient for N1 values
# R2 - R-squared, coefficient of determination for N1 values
# MeanY1est - Mean of N1 values computed from the relationship (estimate dependent values where previously known)
# SY1est - Standard deviation of N1 values computed from the relationship (estimate dependent values where previously known
# RMSE - Root mean squared error for N1 values, computed from regression relationship estimated values
# SEE - Standard error of estimate for N1 values, computed from regression relationship estimated values
# SESlope - Standard error (SE) of the slope (b) for N1 values, computed from regression relationship estimated values
# TestScore - b/SE
# TestQuantile - From the Student's T-test, function of confidence interval and degrees of freedom, DF (N1 - 2)
# TestOK - Yes if TestScore >= TestQuantile, No if otherwise.
# SampleSizeOK - Yes if sample size >= MinimumSampleSize, No if otherwise.
# ROK - Yes if R >= MinimumR, No if otherwise.
# NYfilled - number of filled dependent values
# MeanYfilled - Mean of filled dependent values
# SYfilled - Standard deviation of filled dependent values
# SkewYfilled - Skew of filled dependent values
#
