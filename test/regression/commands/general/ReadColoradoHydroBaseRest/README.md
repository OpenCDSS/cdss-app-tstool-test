# ReadColoradoHydroBaseRest #

This folder contains automated tests for ColoradoHydroBaseRest web services datastore.
The majority of the datastore tests are in the `../TSID_ColoradoHydroBaseRest` folder and are not repeated here.
The tests in this folder focus on testing the features of the `ReadColoradoHydroBaseRest` command,
such as specifying the period of record and using the input filter.
