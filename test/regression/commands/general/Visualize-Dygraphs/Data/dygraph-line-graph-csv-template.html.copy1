<#--
This is a template that is expanded to insert the CSV filename for dygraphs.
The test http server is running in the parent (main command test) folder.
The URL to the expanded file will include Results/xxxx.
Therefore, find the dygraph-combined.js file by walking up the path,
but the CSV data file is in this same folder.
