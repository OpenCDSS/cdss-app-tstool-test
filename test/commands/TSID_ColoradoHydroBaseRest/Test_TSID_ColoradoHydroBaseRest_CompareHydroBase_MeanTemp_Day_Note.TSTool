# This is an example of a station where data load varies:
#   1992-2015 only daily max, min were loaded and mean is average of these
#   2015-2022 daily max, min, and mean were loaded (mean is not calculated)
# Therefore using HydroBase max/min to calculate mean only works for part of the period.
# The enabled tests make sure to only compare the first case with HydroBase.
