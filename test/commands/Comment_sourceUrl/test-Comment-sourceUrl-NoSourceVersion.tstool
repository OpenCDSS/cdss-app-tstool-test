# Test of #@sourceUrl:
# - simulate the local file being newer than the remote file (2024-01-01)
# - to do this, set 'sourceUrl' to a different file
#
#@expectedStatus Warning
#@sourceUrl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenCDSS/cdss-app-tstool-test/master/test/commands/Comment_sourceUrl/data/test-Comment-sourceUrl-no-version.tstool
#@version 2024-01-02
#
# The 'data/workflow.tstool' file is used for 'sourceUrl' and contains a version that can be compared to this file.
# Normally, the source file would be the same file as the command file.
# However, in this case two files are needed to simulate the condition in the repository.
