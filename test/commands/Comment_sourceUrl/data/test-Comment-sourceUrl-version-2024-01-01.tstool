# Test of #@sourceUrl:
# - simulate the local file being older than the remote file
#
# OK to include 'sourceUrl' here, pointing to this file.
#@sourceUrl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenCDSS/cdss-app-tstool-test/master/test/commands/Comment_sourceUrl/data/test-Comment-sourceUrl-version-2024-01-01.tstool
#@versionDate 2024-01-01 
#
# The 'data/workflow.tstool' file is used for 'sourceUrl' and contains a version that is newer than this file.
# Normally, the source file would be the same file as the command file.
# However, in this case two files are needed to simulate the condition in the repository.
