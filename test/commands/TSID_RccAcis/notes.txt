I am using the following HTML:

http://data.rcc-acis.org/doc/VariableTable.html

To populate a list of choices in an application.  Here are some things I found that made your HTML not validate in some XML parsers:

* No <head></head>
* Extra <table>
* Units header should end in </th> but has </td>
* Similar for Source and also need to change <tr> to </tr> at end of header
* Replace <br> with <br/>
