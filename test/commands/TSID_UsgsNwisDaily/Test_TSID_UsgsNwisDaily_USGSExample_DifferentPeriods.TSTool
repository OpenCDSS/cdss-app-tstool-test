# Test reading from the USGS NWIS WaterML REST web service
# Use example shown in the USGS documentation:
# http://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/USGS-DV-Service.html
# This test simply confirms that specifying a period does cause an
# impact on the returned period
#
# Note that setting the period is required because TSID commands rely on the
# global input period during the read and the web service requires a period
#
# Example from URI query formatter
# Short period from USGS example
#
# Not sure why this is failing.  Need to update the USGS NWIS data store
# web services to current standard and figure out what is wrong.
