# Tests for Writing HEC-DSS File #

# Troubleshooting #

Make sure that the DSSUTL.EXE program has execute permissions.

As of 2026-01-02 it does not seem that DSSUTL.EXE is available for recent DSS file format
so need to update the tests to use DSS-VUE (which hopefully will run in batch mode for tests).
