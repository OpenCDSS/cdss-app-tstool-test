# Test table data with some string and some numerical columns:
# - also include embedded properties for PropertyValue format
# - must deal with property quotes because double quotes around a field can be used
# - specify properties with and without space surrounding the equal sign
# - the URL should NOT be treated as a delimiter with properties
# - the URL should not be treated as a property unless quoted
# - use a comma to separate the seventh record properties
